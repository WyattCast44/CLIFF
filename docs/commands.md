# Commands

The primary differnce between commands and options is that options are parsed first.

## Using Classes

- Document 
    - signature, pipe delim
    - description (docstring and attr)
    - init method parameters
    - handle method
    - extending the option class

## Using Functions

You also have the ability to register commands that use functions for the handler. The 
only notable difference is how you register the command(s). Instead of passing a list of 
classes, simply pass a dictionary where the key will be the command signature. If you would
like to display an command help message, simply use a standard docstring. See below for an 
example:

```python
from cliff import Application

def functionBasedCommand(app):
    """Show a quick litte help message"""

    print("\nTODO\n")

Application({
    'name': 'Example App',
    'description': 'This is an example CLI app.',
}).registerCommands({
    'my:command': functionBasedCommand
}).run()
```

```bash
Example App                                      v1.0.0
-------------------------------------------------------
This is an example CLI app.

Usage: app.py [option/command]

Commands:
  my:command  Show a quick litte help message
```
